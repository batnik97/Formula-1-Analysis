Formula 1, renowned for its dynamism and competitiveness, encompasses diverse variables that significantly influence driver performance. Our study aims to gauge the relevance of F1 race constraints in predicting driver performance. Our approach begins by analyzing different models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVC, GaussianNB, and KNeighborsClassifier using the data of active drivers and constructors and comparing them to pick a model to move forward with. We then train the model on data using both drivers and constructors, only drivers, and only constructors. Finally, we incorporate race track data by using their images and leveraging pretrained VGG19 to generate feature maps of these images. Through the utilization of RF-feature importance guided dimensionality reduction, we obtain our highest-performing model which yields a testing accuracy of 0.85. Furthermore, employing feature importance analysis has enabled us to pinpoint the most informative features crucial in predicting race outcomes. This strategic mapping back to these influential features enhances our understanding of their impact on race predictions.
